    "This lecture starts with a brief recap of the previous lecture. Then we will introduce the concept of nonlinear equations and suggest two iterative methods that we can use to solve the nonlinear equations (using Python of course!). We will then code together both methods and apply them to a example (our own square root evaluator, exciting!). We will then deal with a 2x2 nonlinear system, which we will solve using Newton's Method. In the second half of the lecture we will introduce some concepts from statistics and do some examples. "
